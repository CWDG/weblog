# Weblog

This is the introductory Rails exercise. It consists of creating a simple blog without actually having to write more that one line of code. It is named for [DHH's famous talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY).

## Setup

This is an otherwise empty repository. It is up to you to create the entire application.

## Hints

These commands will come in handy. They are not described here. Figuring out what they do should be an exercise for you. Anything in `<>` should not be typed literally, you should interpolate what should go there.

- `rails new <app name here>`
- `rails generate scaffold <model name here (plural!)> <attribute 1>:<attribute 1's type> <attribute2>:...`
- `rake db:setup`
- `rake db:migrate`
- `rails server`

If you get stuck, you can refer to [the Ruby on Rails Guides tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) or any other tutorial for help.
